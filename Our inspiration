<strong><font size="4"> Whether or not anyone wants to admit it, everyone in one point of their life have had an insecurity… leading them to alter the normal way they behave on a daily basis. For example, when someone has a huge pimple, they try to cover the pimple with their hand. When someone gets braces, they don’t talk for a while because they are self conscious about how they look. Some insecurities can be overcomed over time, as with the pimple and braces scenario… but other insecurities cannot be overcomed unless it is directly confronted. This is a concern because many people are unwilling to have their insecurities confronted. This website was created to help combat insecurities and encourage teens to become more self-confident! </font size="4"></strong>
