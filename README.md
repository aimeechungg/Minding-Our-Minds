Minding our minds is a website that targets raising self-confidence in teenagers. Although this website can be used by both teenage girls and boys, we targeted mostly girls in our topic because it has been proven, as shown before, that women have lower self esteem in physical appearance compared with boys. We created this website so teenagers struggling with self confidence can find their true identity according to themselves, not others. Because someone is not confident in speaking in public, it may lead to social anxiety. Because someone is not confident in their body, it may lead to eating disorders. It all stems from within. Making a better change in the society starts from within you.
